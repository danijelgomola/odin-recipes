    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>It's a simple and hearty dessert of cooked ground wheat fortified with ground walnuts and sugar. It's presented at special occasions such as Slava, Christmans and memorial services.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 cup whole wheat berries</li>
        <li>⅛ teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>3 ½ cups chopped walnuts</li>
        <li>2 cups confectioners' sugar</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons blanched slivered almonds</li>
        <li>¼ cup cold heavy whipping cream</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Make the pudding: Place wheat berries in a 3-quart saucepan; add boiling water to cover by 2 inches. Bring to a rolling boil. Let boil for 15 seconds, then drain and discard the water. Repeat five times: add boiling water, bring to a boil, boil for 15 seconds, drain.</li>
        <li>Cover wheat berries again by 2 inches with boiling water. Stir in salt and bring to a boil. Boil for 15 seconds, then remove from the heat without draining. Place the pan on a folded blanket, cover, and wrap with towels or blankets. Let sit at room temperature for 8 hours or overnight.</li>
        <li>The next day, drain any water that hasn't been absorbed. Grind wheat berries thoroughly in a food processor. (If you use a blender, work in very small batches.) Transfer ground wheat to a bowl and clean the food processor.</li>
        <li>Grind walnuts in the food processor until fine. Add confectioners' sugar and process until mixture resembles fine meal. Add ground wheat and pulse until well combined.</li>
        <li>Spoon pudding into a glass trifle bowl or serving dish. Stick slivered almonds into pudding to resemble a porcupine.</li>
        <li>Make the topping: Beat cream in a chilled glass or metal bowl with an electric mixer until stiff peaks form.</li>
        <li>Serve pudding in 2-tablespoon portions in small decorative bowls or custard cups. Top each serving with whipped cream.</li>
    </ol>
