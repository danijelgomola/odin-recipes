    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Lightly grease a casserole dish.</li>
        <li>Cook and stir ground beef in a skillet over medium heat until browned and crumbly, 5 to 7 minutes. Transfer beef and juices to a bowl.</li>
        <li>Heat oil in the same skillet. Add onion, bell pepper, celery, and carrot; sauté until vegetables are tender, 5 to 7 minutes. Return beef to the skillet and season with paprika, black pepper, salt, red pepper flakes, cinnamon, and cloves. Stir in water and wine and cook until heated through, about 5 minutes. Add bouillon and stir until dissolved, 1 to 2 minutes. Remove from the heat and stir in half-and-half.</li>
        <li>Layer 1/2 of the potatoes over the bottom of the prepared casserole dish. Pour beef and vegetable mixture over potatoes, then layer remaining potatoes over top.</li>
        <li>Cover the dish and cook in the preheated oven until potatoes are tender, about 45 minutes.</li>
    </ol>
